# Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) Ripeness Detection System
This project involves a web application developed in Python (Streamlit). \
The YOLOv7 and YOLOv10 models have been used as the main classifiers. \
A **combination** of YOLO and computer vision techniques such as Hough Circles and DBSCAN clustering has also been explored. \
This project was undertaken for my **Master's degree**. The source code will not be shared, as this project is considered an intellectual property of my university. However, a screenshot of the interface will be shown to give the gist of the work that has been done.
